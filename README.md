RobotSport370 Project

What is it?
------------
The RoboSport370 Project is a group project made by a team of 5 in CMPT 370, 
a computer science software engineering class offered by the University of 
Saskatchewan. The projectâ€™s purpose is to simulate a battle between robots 
that have had their AI written in forth code. The simulation is developed to 
work with any forth code so long as it meets the RoboSport370 Standards. 
The Latest Version

Details of the latest can be found in the implementation document.
The project is currently in an early beta stage.
